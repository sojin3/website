Hello everyone! 
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I successfully defended my Ph.D. in May 2024. I currently work with Professor Yannis Theocharis at the Chair of Digital Governance. I am also a member of European Communication Research and Education Association (ECREA) mentoring program. 

My academic background spans sociology, media communication, and political science, and I am particularly interested in researching how technology influences immigrant integration and the information environment.

Originally from Seoul, South Korea, I moved to Mannheim, Germany, for my master's and have since continued my academic career here in Germany.
