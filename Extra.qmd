# Things I do outside academia... :) 

## Women on Web 

### Liberate online abortion information now! (2024)

![](images/wow.png){width=800px align=left margin-right=15px}

Women on Web is a Canadian non-profit organization and online abortion service that provides information about sexual and reproductive health rights and supports access to safe abortion pills in nearly 200 countries. However, the Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC) blocked Women on Web's website, hindering the free flow of information about safe abortion options. In 2024, Women on Web launched a campaign to criticize the KCSC’s decision and raise awareness about their services. I contributed to the campaign as an illustrator.

## The Women Labor Force Campaign: Women in Supermarkets

### 민우회 우리동네 마트액션 : 당연한 의자 캠페인 (2016)

![](images/chair.png){width=800px align=left margin-right=15px}

   In 2016, Womenlink launched a campaign to guarantee the ‘right to sit’ for women working in supermarkets. In South Korea, the majority of supermarket workers are middle-aged women. Despite working full-time, many of them are not allowed to sit during their shifts because some customers complain that sitting makes them appear arrogant. Our campaign aimed to challenge this perception and highlight that these workers are human beings who endure physical pain. I contributed to the campaign as an illustrator.

   As a member of one of South Korea’s oldest feminist organizations, “Womenlink,” I participated in a project investigating the current state of the plastic surgery industry, serving as both a researcher and illustrator. Our team explored the industry’s structure by collecting online advertisements, interviewing industry workers and victims, and creating content that exposed the issues within this sector.
